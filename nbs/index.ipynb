It's designed to automate the process of compiling, building, and preparing a software application or service. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what `make all` does in the provided Makefile script:\n",

    "1. **`login:`** This target logs into the Snowflake Docker repository. It's the initial step to ensure that subsequent operations, such as pushing a Docker image, can authenticate against the Snowflake registry. The `docker login` command uses the `$(SNOWFLAKE_REPO)` variable, which should contain the URL of the Snowflake Docker repository.\n",

It specifies the platform as `linux/amd64`, uses a Dockerfile located in the `infra` directory, and tags the resulting image with the name specified in the `$(DOCKER_IMAGE)` variable. This step prepares the Docker image with the necessary environment and dependencies for the application.\n",

    "## GitHub Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate your project with GitHub and enable automated workflows, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up GitHub Secrets**: Ensure your GitHub repository contains the necessary secrets for authentication and access to your Snowflake instance. The setup should resemble the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Add GitHub Secrets](./DataScience/files/images/add_secerts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Refer to the [GitHub Secrets documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) for detailed instructions on how to create and manage secrets for your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure GitHub Actions**: With GitHub secrets in place, navigate to your repository's GitHub Actions to trigger the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Go to Repo Actions](./DataScience/files/images/github_action.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trigger the Workflow**: Manually trigger the workflow by selecting the appropriate action and providing any necessary inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Trigger Workflow](./DataScience/files/images/run_github_action.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Successfully triggering the workflow culminates in the construction of a RandomForestRegressor. This model, once trained, is utilized for predictions, subsequently recorded back into Snowflake. Future tutorials will delve into more sophisticated workflows, enhancing your data science projects within Snowflake.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Caution**: This tutorial does not encompass the entirety of a data science project's requirements. It serves as an introductory guide, with plans to expand on Snowflake's native ML capabilities, Cortex, and other projects. Stay tuned for updates and explore different branches for additional developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After workflow completion, delve into the notebooks for insights and outcomes verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Click into job_nbs](./DataScience/files/images/click_jobs_nbs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Click into RanJobs](./DataScience/files/images/jobs_ran_from_github.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Result of GitHub Actions](./DataScience/files/images/result_of_action.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewing these notebooks aids in debugging and ensures everything performed as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Explore Inference Notebook Run](./DataScience/files/images/look_at_ran_nbs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For continued exploration, re-triggering the notebook facilitates additional predictions, exemplifying how automation, such as cron jobs in GitHub, can enhance your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Run Action Again](./DataScience/files/images/run_again.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, view the prediction outcomes within your Snowflake database.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Snowflake Database](./DataScience/files/images/final_result.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, here are some common troubleshooting steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Login Issues**: If you're unable to log in, ensure that you're using the correct credentials and that the application has had sufficient time to become operational.\n",
    "2. **GitHub Secrets**: Double-check that your GitHub secrets are set up correctly and that the required permissions are in place.\n",
    "3. **Workflow Errors**: Review the output from the GitHub Actions workflow for any error messages or clues about what might be causing the issue.\n",
    "4. **Snowflake Connectivity**: Verify that your Snowflake instance is accessible and that you have the necessary permissions to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the issue persists, feel free to reach out to the support team for further assistance.\n",
    "\n",
