# Welcome Snowpark Container Services (SPCS) For Data Science

## SPCS Data Science Series

This repository is part of a series that will continue to evolve,
finding ways to leverage SPCS to make our lives easier as data
scientists and machine learning engineers. We’ll be enhancing
Snowflake’s native capabilities alongside SPCS to create templates
adaptable to any direction. After setting up your work environment in
Snowflake, the next steps involve building the desired data science
workflow. As the series develops, we’ll explore and refine these
workflows.

## Part 1: Data Science Workload in Snowflake with SPCS

## Future Work

1.  **Data Ingestion**  
    [Data Ingestion Snowpark - Great
    Article](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-data-engineering-with-snowpark-python/tree/main).
    Ideally, this repo eventually becomes something similar, providing
    comprehensive data ingestion and MLOps capabilities.

2.  **Feature Store & Data Preprocessing**  
    Snowflake is working on a feature store that’s currently in preview.
    Once available, we’ll demonstrate its potential in project
    workflows.

    - We’ll discuss both offline and batch feature stores.
    - Monitoring data drift is crucial to ensure that our data hasn’t
      drifted significantly, as this may require retraining models.

3.  **Model Training and Model Registering**  
    Our goal is to highlight the power of SPCS, Snowflake ML, and
    Snowflake Cortex. We’ll demonstrate how these tools can integrate
    effectively.

4.  **Model Inference**  
    We will explore various options for model inference in Snowflake.
